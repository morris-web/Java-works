Question:
Develop a JAVA Program for a grading system that satisfies the 
following requirement. 
1.  Requirement for passing an exam is that, student must pass the 
exam by a score of 25 or more and must also pass the assessment by 15 
or more to get a certificate. 
2.  If a student score a total grade of 39 for both grading 
component(i.e. if only a student score exam 25 and assessment 14 
totalling 39 , or exam 24 and assessment 15 totalling 39), the 
student is condoned. 
3.   If a student satisfy Req. 1 or Req. 2 and have paid their fees 
in full(where fee is 100), they are issued with a certificate. 
4.   A student is deemed to have failed if he/she does not meet Req. 
1 or Req. 2 
5.   However, your program must inform a student which component 
he/she passed/failed 
6.   Where a student fail both components he/she is repeated

Code:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class GradingSystem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Get input from user
        System.out.print("Enter exam score: ");
        int examScore = input.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter assessment score: ");
        int assessmentScore = input.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter fee amount: ");
        int fee = input.nextInt();

        // Calculate total grade
        int totalGrade = examScore + assessmentScore;

        // Check if student passed both components
        boolean passedExam = examScore >= 25;
        boolean passedAssessment = assessmentScore >= 15;
        boolean passedBoth = passedExam && passedAssessment;

        // Check if student qualifies for certificate
        boolean qualifiesForCertificate = false;
        if (passedBoth) {
            qualifiesForCertificate = true;
        } else if (totalGrade == 39) {
            qualifiesForCertificate = true;
        }

        // Check if student has paid fee
        boolean hasPaidFee = fee == 100;

        // Determine if student passed or failed each component
        String examResult = examScore >= 25 ? "passed" : "failed";
        String assessmentResult = assessmentScore >= 15 ? "passed" : "failed";

        // Print results
        if (passedBoth && hasPaidFee) {
            System.out.println("Congratulations, you have passed and have paid your fees. You qualify for a certificate.");
        } else if (totalGrade == 39 && hasPaidFee) {
            System.out.println("Congratulations, you have passed and have paid your fees. You qualify for a certificate.");
        } else if (passedExam && hasPaidFee) {
            System.out.println("Congratulations, you passed the your exam and have paid your fees.");
            System.out.println("You " + assessmentResult + " your assessment.");
        } else if (passedAssessment && hasPaidFee) {
            System.out.println("Congratulations, you passed your assessment and have paid your fees.");
            System.out.println("You " + examResult + " your exam.");
        } else if (totalGrade == 39 && !hasPaidFee) {
            System.out.println("You have passed but have not paid your fees. Please pay your fees to qualify for a certificate.");
        } else if (passedBoth && !hasPaidFee) {
            System.out.println("You have passed but have not paid your fees. Please pay your fees to qualify for a certificate.");
        } else if (passedExam) {
            System.out.println("You passed the your exam.");
            System.out.println("You " + assessmentResult + " your assessment.");
        } else if (passedAssessment) {
            System.out.println("You passed your assessment.");
            System.out.println("You " + examResult + " your exam.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Sorry, you failed. You will need to repeat the exam.");
        }
    }
}
